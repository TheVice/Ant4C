ant4c (YYYY.MM)
  * Increased stack that used at BLAKE3 algorithm to allow calculate
    hashes of inputs with huge (more than 32 KB) length.
  * At implementation of 'SHA3/Keccak' algorithm do not loading whole
    range of data while calculating hash sum of first one.
  * Clang: added workaround code that prevents optimization that cause
    distortion of the function that calculate 'Keccak' and 'SHA3' sums.
    Previous releases for FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems,
    that was build by Clang compiler, calculate that sums incorrect.
  * Added 'operating-system::is-windows-server' and
    'platform::is-windows-server' functions.
  * Added new line after target name while print project help for
    target that do not have 'description'.
  * Added calculation of hash sums according to 'xxh32' and 'xxh64'
    algorithms.
  * Fixed encoding to the UTF16BE and UTF16LE symbols that transforming
    into surrogate pairs.
  * Fixed issue at the 'path_get_full_path' function,
    added possibility to deal with paths that contains '..':
    'C:\a..a\', '/tmp/a..a' for example.
  * Function 'platform::get-name()' now return name of platform
    not the name of operation system.
  * Function 'version_exec_function' from version unit allow to work with
    empty arguments - they will be interpreted as zero versions.
  * Fixed issue with using non exists property as argument - name of this
    property was used, that actually wrong.
    Instead program now stop interpret script in that case.
  * Fixed issue with detecting of arguments area border when used special
    symbol in the argument quote.
    For example: ${string::equal('False', string::contains(i, ')'))}.
  * Fixed issue at the 'string_last_index_of_any' function: first of symbols
    from 'any' list will not be compared with symbols from input string.
  * Allowed to build at Apple macOS environment.
  * Added 'platform::is-macos' function.
  * WIN32: fixed using at 'echo' task for scenario when output stream
    redirected to the file by capability of operation system -
    for example: 'ant4c.exe > 1.txt'.

ant4c (2020.09)
  * Introduced support of modules.
  * Functions from the path unit allowed to operate with empty paths.
    Function 'combine' can be used for normalizing path.
  * Increased list of symbols to trim from string at 'string::trim'
    function.
  * Replaced script hash functions with hash length at the names with
    'blake2b', 'blake3', 'keccak' and 'sha3'.
  * Added support of 'blake3' and 'keccak' algorithms at the script
    function 'file::get-checksum'.
  * Added argument for configure algorithm - byte order, hash length,
    to the 'file::get-checksum' function.
  * Added possibility to use external events listener.
  * Added 'loadtasks' task.
  * For POSIX systems added searching of files with '.build' extension,
    if no file provided at command prompt.
  * Added 'path::glob' function.
  * Allowed to call executable from the directory that was set
    at the PATH environment variable.

ant4c (2020.05)

  * Attempt to set value for read only property will not fail
    evaluation of script.
  * Fixed enumeration of target dependencies if space or/and tabs
    was used between names.
  * Fixed enumeration of strings with non ASCII chars at 'for_each' task.
  * WIN32: fixed print of non ASCII chars at the terminal.

ant4c (2020.04)

  * Added support of UTF8 encoding at the string unit.
  * Added new tasks 'attrib', 'call', 'choose', 'copy',
    'delete', 'description', 'fail', 'foreach', 'if',
    'loadfile', 'mkdir', 'move', 'program', 'property',
    'sleep', 'touch' and 'trycatch' to early exists 'echo' and 'exec'.
  * Added hash unit with 'crc32', 'BLAKE2b', 'BLAKE3',
    'SHA3/Keccak' algorithms. Algorithms 'crc32' and 'BLAKE2b'
    also available for 'file::get-checksum' script function.
  * Tag elements 'project' and 'target' internally also marked as tasks.

ant4c (2019.10.21)

  * Available tasks 'echo', 'exec' and 'property'.
  * Available functions from name spaces 'bool', 'cygpath, datetime',
    'double', 'environment', 'int', 'int64', 'long', 'math',
    'operating-system', 'path', 'platform', 'program', 'project',
    'property, 'string', 'timespan' and 'version'.
